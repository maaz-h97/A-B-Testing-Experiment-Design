# A-B-Testing-Experiment-Design
A/B testing experiment design and statistical analysis using hypothesis testing (Z-Test for proportions), combined with Tableau dashboard visualization of conversion rates.

## Overview

This project involves designing and analyzing an A/B testing experiment to determine the effectiveness of a treatment over a control group.  
Statistical hypothesis testing (two-proportion Z-Test) was used to assess significance, and an interactive Tableau dashboard visualized conversion rate comparisons.

---

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Scipy.stats, Matplotlib)
- Tableau
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Steps

- Data Preparation for A/B Groups
- Calculation of Conversion Rates
- Hypothesis Formulation (Null and Alternative)
- Statistical Testing (Z-Test for Proportions)
- Tableau Dashboard Development for Results Visualization

---

## ðŸ“š Key Insights

- No statistically significant difference was found between control and treatment groups based on conversion rates (p-value > 0.05).
- Treatment group showed a slightly higher conversion rate, but it was not significant enough to reject the null hypothesis.
- Tableau dashboard enables easy comparison of A/B conversion metrics across groups.
